>>Very simple. Uses arrow keys to move the snake. Snake grows when it touches the food, represented by alphabet F. And it dies when it touches the wall or itself! 
>* My own Vi editor
>>besides the basic function of a vi editor, I also implemented many other functions

> * Bank Account Management System
>> used pointers to implement a basic bank system. You can assign different accounts for one person and also withdraw or deposit from your account. In addition, you can loan money from the bank.
 
## Things I want to improve/ implement in the future 
>> Snake game: maybe add some AI functions to it, making it to move by itself. Implementing an algorithm for the snake to decidce which direction it should move in order to gain maximum score.
>> 
>> Vi editor : I want to add colors to it to make it more visually pleasing.
